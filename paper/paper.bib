	abstract = {Research and diagnostics for medically relevant tandem repeats and repeat expansions are hampered by the lack of population-scale databases. We attempt to fill this gap using our pathSTR web tool, which leverages long-read sequencing of large cohorts to determine repeat length and sequence composition in the general population. The current version includes 878 individuals of the 1000 Genomes Project cohort sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION. A comprehensive set of medically relevant tandem repeats were genotyped using STRdust to determine the tandem repeat length and sequence composition. PathSTR provides rich visualizations of this dataset, as well as the feature to upload one{\textquoteright}s own data for comparison along the control cohort. We demonstrate the implementation of this application using data from targeted nanopore sequencing of a patient with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1. This resource will empower the genetics community to get a more complete overview of normal variation in tandem repeat length and sequence composition, and enable a better assessment of the pathogenic impact of tandem repeats observed in patients.

	abstract = {Motivation Long read sequencing technology is becoming an increasingly indispensable tool in genomic and transcriptomic analysis. In transcriptomics in particular, long reads offer the possibility of sequencing full-length isoforms, which can vastly simplify the identification of novel transcripts and transcript quantification. However, despite this promise, the focus of much long read method development to date has been on transcript identification, with comparatively little attention paid to quantification. Yet, due to differences in the underlying protocols and technologies, lower throughput (i.e. fewer reads sequenced per sample compared to short read technologies), as well as technical artifacts, long read quantification remains a challenge, motivating the continued development and assessment of quantification methods tailored to this increasingly prevalent type of data.Results We introduce a new method and software tool for long read transcript quantification called oarfish. Our model incorporates a novel and innovative coverage score, which affects the conditional probability of fragment assignment in the underlying probabilistic model. We demonstrate that by accounting for this coverage information, oarfish is able to produce more accurate quantification estimates than existing long read quantification methods, particularly when one considers the primary isoforms present in a particular cell line or tissue type.Availability and Implementation Oarfish is implemented in the Rust programming language, and is made available as free and open-source software under the BSD 3-clause license.
